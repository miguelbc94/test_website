I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the European University Institute (EUI), in Florence, Italy. I am on the Job Market 2025/26 season. My research interests are Industrial Organization and Competition Policy, Pubic Economics and Law and Economics. You can find a short summary of my Ph.D. dissertation [here](/thesis_outline.pdf)

I am currently working in topics related to the design of taxes and subsidies in industries in which firms have market power, and in which consumers can buy the same good in multiple periods at different prices. I am also working in the determinants of pass-through of subsidies and taxes in such settings. 

In my free time, I am passionate about sports, particularly soccer, cycling and running. I also enjoy reading about History and Geography and cooking.
