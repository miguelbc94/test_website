      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;subsidy-design-with-forward-looking-consumers&#34;&gt;Subsidy Design with Forward-Looking Consumers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I study the optimal design of subsidies for consumers when they are forward-looking and can decide to postpone purchases to future periods. This is especially relevant when firms employ intertemporal price discrimination techniques, as ad-valorem subsidy designs can cause government expenditures to increase more than proportionally due to subsidized consumers waiting for the final periods, when prices are higher. Using a real-life setting of subsidized consumers in the airline industry in Spain, I document how an increase in the percentage of the subsidy shifted purchases towards the final periods. I then develop a model with forward-looking consumers and firms practicing intertemporal pricing to study how equilibrium prices and period-specific demand vary depending on the subsidy design. The aim is to estimate the parameters of this model using data from this industry to quantify the magnitude of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
