## Subsidy Design with Forward-Looking Consumers

Abstract

In this paper, I study the optimal design of subsidies for consumers when they are forward-looking and can decide to postpone purchases to future periods. This is especially relevant when firms employ intertemporal price discrimination techniques, as ad-valorem subsidy designs can cause government expenditures to increase more than proportionally due to subsidized consumers waiting for the final periods, when prices are higher. Using a real-life setting of subsidized consumers in the airline industry in Spain, I document how an increase in the percentage of the subsidy shifted purchases towards the final periods. I then develop a model with forward-looking consumers and firms practicing intertemporal pricing to study how equilibrium prices and period-specific demand vary depending on the subsidy design. The aim is to estimate the parameters of this model using data from this industry to quantify the magnitude of these changes.

## The Determinants of Pass-Through with Dynamic Demand

Abstract

Despite its prevalence as a policy tool, little is known about the effects of taxes and subsidies to consumers
in industries with capacity constraints and in which consumers can purchase in multiple periods. This project
aims at studying the effect of these features on pass through in oligopolistic markets. Using data from the
airline industry in Spain I quantify the pass-through of a subsidy increase and how it varies with the intensity
of competition, time left to departure and the presence of capacity constraints. I then develop a theoretical
model to rationalize the observed effects, and I show that time to departure and capacity constraints are relevant
features that affect the usual determinants of pass-through in oligopolistic settings. I also show how the presence
of strategic substitutabilities between prices in different periods alter the usual analysis of the effect of competition
on pass-through, and how this can explain a negative impact of competition on pass-through rates.
